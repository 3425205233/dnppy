======================================================================================
 The "landsat" module is part of the "dnppy" package (develop national program py).
 This module houses python functions for performing image processing tasks on Landsat 4,
 5, 7, and 8 data.

 If you wrote a function you think should be added to this module, or have an idea for one
 you wish was available, please email the Geoinformatics YP class or code it up yourself
 for future DEVELOP participants to use!
