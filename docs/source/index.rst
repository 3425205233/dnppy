Welcome to the dnppy documentation page!
========================================

The DEVELOP national program python package (``dnppy``) is as a living codebase for the `NASA DEVELOP National Program`_, our project partners, and the GIS programming community! DEVELOP is under NASA's "Capacity Building" program, and functions to educate its participants and its partners in earth science and remote sensing. Viewers will notice a very instructional approach to both user and developer documentation within these pages. ``dnppy`` was created to improve institutional knowledge retention, open the DEVELOP toolkit for public contributions and use, represent DEVELOP in the public domain, and put more power in the hands of new participants the first day the walk into the program. It is a social media, programming capacity building, and educational endeavor.

Note from the Author
====================

The DEVELOP program is a great program, and is that way because of its great participants. I came in as a participant with a background in aerospace engineering and exposure to image analysis with a method called particle image velocimetry for use in wind tunnels. I had zero knowledge of GIS, earth science, climate science, agronomy, hydrology, geology, or the type of remote sensing done via satellite, but I wanted to learn. I was not a very good programmer. The environment I was exposed to with DEVELOP allowed me to sponge up the immense knowledge of my peers from all sorts of disciplines, and I soon realized the importance of good programming in the programming and in the community as a whole.

Firstly, DEVELOP expects participants to come in, learn about a topic, plan an analysis, and produce results in 10 weeks. I am continuously impressed with the achievements of the DEVELOP cohort, and the frequency with which they meet stiff objectives. Performing an analysis is one thing, but creating software tools for partners and end users to repeat that analysis is something else entirely. With the growing number of freely available earth observation data sources, the analysis has grown even more complex over time. The need for better software tools that could be learned and implemented more quickly became clear. Secondly, project partners who come to us often reveal that some of their largest stumbling blocks to using NASA data products are actually quite simple for a programmer to solve. For some, an entire new world can be opened up with the simple ability to mass extract data from an HDF5 or a NetCDF and take some statistics. All they need is the right tools.

The need for good programming in the GIS community became clear, so ``dnppy`` was idealized. Over the last 2 years I worked to improve my programming skills to meet the professional standard (which I continue to do), and over the last 9 months, I've worked with a team of Geoinformatics Fellows to conceptualize and realize ``dnppy``. It has been a rewarding and exciting experience for me.

I ask the members of the community to adopt it as their own. If you are a student or recent graduate using this package, I encourage you to take a look at the NASA DEVELOP program and consider applying. If you look at some of this code in disgust and anguish at some foolish design choice we've made, we welcome your feedback and contributions through the GitHub.
