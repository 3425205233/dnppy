raster
======

The raster module is used to analyze raster data from non-specific sources. In an idealized workflow, use of the convert and download modules can help users obtain and pre-process data for use with functions in the raster module. The modules capabilities include statistics generation, subsetting, reprojecting, null data management, correction functions, and others. Top level functions in the raster module should all have batch processing capabilities bult in.
