convert
=======

Used to convert raw data products as they are distributed from their various Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACâ€™s) into more easily handled file types like GeoTiffs. This module is currently expanding to handle as many NASA data products as possible, particularly those in NetCDF and HDF5 formats with incomplete or implicit geographic referencing information. Each of these functions should allow easy batch processing on entire directories of similar files.
