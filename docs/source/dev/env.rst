Development Environment
=======================

There are a few recommendations that can be made to those working to enhance their programming skills and get deeper into development. One of those is to spend some time selecting, and getting comfortable with an IDE.

We highly recommend users download `PyCharm`_ by JetBrains to work on sets of python code, but especially if working on dnppy. PyCharm gives the user tips and warnings when coding best practices are violated, which can encourage you to adopt more professional practice and learn things you didn't even think to ask about! It also has powerful refactoring tools and great error catching on the fly to help you spend less time fixing small mistakes. Pycharm works well on both Windows and Linux.
