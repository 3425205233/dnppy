DEVELOP National Program Python Package (dnppy)

This collection of python modules serves as a living codebase
for the DEVELOP National Program. Teams in the NASA DEVELOP program increasingly 
find themselves using some level of programming to manipulate project data. 
Most of the time, this data manipulation is performed in Python. The DEVELOP 
Python package, referred to as “dnppy” (done py) was created to improve institutional 
knowledge retention, open the DEVELOP toolkit for public contributions and 
use, represent DEVELOP in the public domain, and put more power in the hands 
of new participants the first day the walk into the program. It is a joint 
social media and programming capacity building endeavor.
