NASA DEVELOP project teams contribute specialized code to this directory. Project code is evaluated for its general applicability to the larger dnppy framework and is refactored and deployed on a case by case basis. 

Code in this directory should be functional, but may have a very narrow focus and lack scalability. This directory is NOT included in the install package, and should NOT be referenced by any deployed code, though it is expected most code in this folder will be dnppy dependent.
