This folder holds code that is packaged with dnppy for good record keeping, but is NOT installed with the module. There are a few different categories that code like this falls within, and it is organized as such.

####/subjects
This repository is filled with unstructured code for a general purpose that could be usefull to refactor and add to the dnppy framework in the near future.

####/proj_code
NASA DEVELOP project teams contribute specialized code to this directory. Project code is evaluated for its generality and moved up to the subjects folder, then into dnppy if some generalization is possible. Code in this directory may have a very narrow focus on the needs of the project partners and lack scalability. 

####/legacy
This is old code from before the days of configuration management that might have very useful snippets to pull into dnppy_install.
