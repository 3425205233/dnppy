Code in this direcory may have utility for specific DEVELOP project partners. Each folder will be named according to 
`Year_Term_Node_ProjectShortTitle` such as `2015_Spring_LaRC_VA_agriculture`. 


Upon creation of a final code deliverable, perform the following tasks.

1. Create a folder with the name `Year_Term_Node_ProjectShortTitle` such as `2015_Spring_LaRC_VA_agriculture`
2. Place all project code in this folder using an organizational scheme of your choice.
3. The level of documentation you provide is at your discretion. Simple in-code comments may be sufficient for simple applications, but code intended to be run by project partners should have decent tutorial document included in this folder.
4. Create a readme file named exactly "README.md" with the following information:
 * A brief description of this folders content and how it was used in meeting the projects objectives.
 * How to run the code, and the order in which scripts are executed or processes were run, if applicable.
 * The dependencies and packages required to run the scripts including versions. (ex: dnppy, gdal, scipy, matplotlib)
5. zip the folder containing this file up and send it to the geoinformatics point of contact. It will then be made available right here on github for download and reference by the public.


Do not include any non-text files in this folder! This means no sample raster data or extensive shapefiles. Your whole zipped folder should be only a few kilobytes in size.
