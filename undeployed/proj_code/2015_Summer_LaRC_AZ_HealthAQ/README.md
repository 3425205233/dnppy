There are two folders distinguishing the type of code between data organization (DataOrganization) and actual analysis (Analysis) for the Arizona Health and Air Quality Summer 2015 term. 

In DataOrganization the user will find the scripts we used to access MODIS and API MesoWest data, as well as the scripts used to put these files in a useable format. This folder contains a separate README explaining the order and use of code.

In Analysis, the user will find information on our statistics as well as spatial consistency analysis. There is a separate README that entails the order and use of each script.
