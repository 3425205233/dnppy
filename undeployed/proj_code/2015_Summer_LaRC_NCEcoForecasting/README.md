This folder contains the code used to pre-process and analyze data for the 
NC Eco Forecasting project. Inline comments in the code provide details on what 
processes the code preforms and how to use it. 

The user needs to change the file path of the DIRECTORY variable to where the 
Landsat data they would like to process is stored. The script then preforms data
pre-processing and analysis on the images. 

This code is dependent on Arcpy and dnppy installs.
